Image Processing Algorithms Implementation in Matlab - [practice for understanding purposes]

色々な画像処理のアルゴリズムMATLABで実験して見ました。
Experimented with various image processing techniques.

- geoemtric_mean_filter (window_size=3x3)
- geoemtric_mean_filter (window_size=5x5)
- harmonic_mean_filter (window_size=3x3)
- harmonic_mean_filter (window_size=5x5)
- contraharmonic_mean_filter (window_size=3x3)
- contraharmonic_mean_filter (window_size=5x5)
- derivative_gaussian_wrt_x  (with respect to X) (window_size=3x3)
- derivative_gaussian_wrt_y  (with respect to Y) (window_size=3x3)
- gaussian_kernel (window_size=9x9)
- laplacian_of_gaussian (window_size=3x3)


White-Bars.png is the image used to test the above kernels.
